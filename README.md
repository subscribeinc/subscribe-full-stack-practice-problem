# subscribe-full-stack-practice-problem

## Objective

Create a small web application using Remix.run and Strapi CMS that is a trip reports database. Trip reports are user-submitted posts about trips they have taken.

You do not need to implement auth. Implement create and read functionality. The app should list trip report summaries, display full trip reports, and accept trip report submissions.

This is intentionally open-ended. You should spend ~2 hrs on this.

## Requirements

1. Must list trip report summaries
1. Must have dynamic route that displays a single trip report in detail
1. Must accept trip report submissions
1. Frontend must be a Remix.run project with Typescript
1. Backend must be a Strapi CMS v4
1. Must use TailwindCSS for styling
1. Must be mobile responsive

## Bonus

1. Visitors can "like" or "upvote" a trip report (no limit on number of likes/upvotes since we don't have auth)
1. Implement a second collection type in Strapi and the frontend
1. Demonstrate a mastery of nested routing and the loaders and actions concepts in Remix
1. Implement a Strapi plugin
1. Use custom react hook(s)
1. Deploy the application stack
1. Implement a custom plugin in Strapi
1. Write basic tests
